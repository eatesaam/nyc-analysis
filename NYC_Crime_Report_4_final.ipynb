The chart shows that the most common crime in New York City is petit larceny, followed by grand larceny, robbery, burglary, and dangerous weapons. Petit larceny is the theft of property worth less than $1,000. Grand larceny is the theft of property worth more than $1,000. Robbery is the taking of property from another person by the use of force or the threat of force. Burglary is the unlawful entry of a building with the intent to commit a crime. Dangerous weapons includes possession of a firearm, assault weapon, or other deadly weapon. The chart also shows that the crime rate varies by neighborhood. The neighborhoods with the highest crime rates are Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and East New York. The neighborhoods with the lowest crime rates are the Upper East Side, Battery Park City, and the Financial District. Thefts account for the majority of major crimes in New York City, with petit larceny and grand larceny making up over 50% of all major crimes. Violent crimes, such as robbery and felony assault, are less common, but still account for a significant number of major crimes. The crime rate varies by neighborhood, with some neighborhoods having significantly higher crime rates than others."

In 2021, the crime rate was down 11% from the previous year. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including increased policing, improved community relations, and economic development. Despite the decline in crime, there are still some neighborhoods in New York City with high crime rates.
